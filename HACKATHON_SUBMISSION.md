## What ShipFlow AI does

ShipFlow AI is a **full-stack AI-assisted product delivery platform** that manages the entire lifecycle from feature request to production ship:

```
Employee submits request
  → AI triage (priority, risk, effort, clarifying questions)
  → PRD generated (goals, acceptance criteria, technical requirements, rollback plan)
  → Engineering tasks generated (typed, ordered, with per-task acceptance criteria)
  → Developer codes → GitHub PR auto-linked
  → AI reviews PR diff against PRD (9 dimensions, file-level issues, suggestions)
  → If blocking issues: developer fixes → delta re-review checks each issue
  → AI passes → Human PM approves / rejects / requests changes
  → Approved → Ship to production
```

Every step is tracked, queryable via 37 MCP tools, and accessible via the ShipFlow Agent chat.

| API health | `/health` + `/ready` both return 200 |
| No broken endpoints | HMAC guard returns 401 (not 500) on unsigned webhooks |
| Database | Neon PostgreSQL — 53 migrations, seeded demo data |

| What we built | Files |
|---|---|
| 9-dimension PR code review | `packages/services/feature-ai.ts` → `runPrAiReview` |

| SSE streaming with action cards | `apps/api/src/routes/agent-stream.ts` |
| MCP 2024-11-05 server | `apps/api/src/routes/mcp.ts` |

### Review Loop & Human Approval

| What we built | Files |
|---|---|
| Iteration tracking with increment | `packages/services/review.ts` → `persistAiReview` |
| Delta comparison (resolved/persisting/new) | `review.ts` → `getReviewDelta` |
| Review health stats | `review.ts` → `getReviewStats` |
| Approval gate validation | `review.ts` → `validateHumanApprovalEligibility` |
| Human approval: approve/reject/changes | `review.ts` → `recordHumanApproval` |
| Full approval audit trail | `review.ts` → `listHumanApprovals` |
| Delta-aware re-review in PR flow | `packages/services/github/pr-review.ts` |
| 6-stage workflow with delta messaging | `packages/services/workflows/ai-review-workflow.ts` |
| Agent tools: approve/reject/changes | `shipflow-agent-tools.ts` → 7 new tools |

### GitHub Integration

| What we built | Files |
|---|---|
| GitHub App + Octokit | `packages/services/github/client.ts` |
| 55-min token cache | `client.ts` |
| Paginated repo sync (fixes 100-repo ceiling) | `github/installation.ts` |
| HMAC-SHA256 webhook verification | `github/installation.ts` → `verifyGithubWebhookSignature` |
| `installation.deleted` handling | `github/webhook.ts` → `processGithubInstallationWebhook` |
| `installation_repositories.removed` | `github/webhook.ts` |
| PR → feature auto-linking | `github/webhook.ts` → `processGithubPullRequestWebhook` |
| Merged PR → `human_review` (PM sign-off) | `github/webhook.ts` — pre-approved → `approved` |

| Paginated PR diff (no 100-file ceiling) | `github/diff.ts` |
| Per-file patch truncation + binary exclusion | `github/diff.ts` |
| Rich PR body with PRD checklist | `github/pr.ts` |

### Code Quality

| What we built | Evidence |
|---|---|
| 100% TypeScript, zero errors | `pnpm check-types` → 0 errors in CI |
| Database type correctness | boolean/integer (not text) for `readyForHuman`, `progress`, `credits` |

## Key differentiators vs. other submissions

### 1. Delta-aware AI re-review
Most submissions run the same generic review every time. ShipFlow's `runDeltaAiReview` specifically checks each blocking issue from the previous iteration and classifies it as `RESOLVED / PARTIALLY_RESOLVED / UNRESOLVED`. The AI cannot mark a re-review as passing without verifying each prior issue was fixed.

### 2. Approval gate enforced at all entry points
`validateHumanApprovalEligibility` is called before any `approve_feature` action — whether from the UI button, agent tool, or tRPC mutation. If the latest AI review has blocking issues, approval is blocked with a specific error explaining why.

### 3. 37 MCP tools with CI parity test
The agent and MCP server share the same 37 tools, verified by a CI test (`tool-parity.test.ts`). Tools include `approve_feature`, `reject_feature`, `request_changes`, `get_review_delta`, `get_review_stats`, `get_approval_history` — a complete PM workflow accessible from Cursor or Claude Desktop.

### 4. Production-grade GitHub App integration
- Installation token cache (55 min TTL) — no JWT round-trip on every request
- Paginated repo sync — no 100-repo ceiling
- Delivery-ID idempotency guard — Postgres `github_webhook_deliveries` prevents double-processing of replayed webhooks
- `installation.deleted` webhook disconnects org and evicts token
- Merged PR → feature transitions to `human_review` (human gate preserved)
- Review comments update in-place (no spam on each push)

### 5. Technical PRD with security + rollback plan
`generateFeaturePrd` produces 10 structured sections including `technicalRequirements`, `securityRequirements`, `testingStrategy`, and `rollbackPlan`. Most AI tools generate vague goal/story lists — ShipFlow generates specs that engineers can implement and security teams can audit.
